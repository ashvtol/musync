Sync Music from iTunes to Android

###What does this program do ?
Let me put this it this way, say you have a huge  music libraray which is well organized by some other application say iTunes,
now to copy those new song, you either copy-paste it from your download folder amid other songs (very carefully pick the new ones)
or you go to the recently added playlist on iTunes and see the list of the new songs and copy each one individually, I understand 
it can be a big problem if you running short on time. 

* So what this program does is 'PUSHES ONLY THE NEW SONGS FROM YOUR EXISTING MUSIC LIBRARY TO YOUR ANDROID DEVICE', congratulations,
you saved yourslef some time.
