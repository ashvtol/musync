# Musync

Sync Music from iTunes to Android

###What does this program do ?
Let me put this it this way, say you have a huge  music library which is well organized by some other application say iTunes, if you
have not updated your phone in a while then to copy those new songs, you either copy-paste it from your download folder amid other songs (very carefully pick the new ones) or you go to the recently added playlist on iTunes and see the list of the new songs and copy each one individually, I understand it can be a big problem if you running short of time. 


###PUSHES ONLY THE NEW SONGS FROM YOUR EXISTING MUSIC LIBRARY TO YOUR ANDROID DEVICE
